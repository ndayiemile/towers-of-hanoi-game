This project implements the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle in Java. The main logic is in `Towers.java`, which allows you to solve the puzzle for any number of rings.

## How to Run

To run the Towers of Hanoi game, compile and execute the `Towers` class, providing the number of rings as a command-line argument:

```
javac Towers.java
java Towers <number_of_rings>
```

For example, to solve the puzzle with 3 rings:

```
java Towers 3
```

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains source files (e.g., `App.java`)
- `Towers.java`: Main Towers of Hanoi implementation
- `bin/`: Compiled output files

## Notes

- `App.java` is a simple example entry point and not related to the Towers of Hanoi logic.
